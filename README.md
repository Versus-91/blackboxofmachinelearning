Machine Learning Algorithm Decision-Making Interpretability Study
Overview
This project aims to explore the decision-making process of different machine learning algorithms by employing interpretability methods, specifically Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and feature importance analysis. The study investigates the advantages and disadvantages of each method when applied to a diverse set of datasets.

Methods
The following machine learning algorithms will be analyzed:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
K Nearest Neighbors
Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine
Simple Neural Networks
Objectives
Evaluate the interpretability and transparency of these algorithms using PDP and feature importance methods.
Investigate how effectively PDP and feature importance can reveal the decision-making process of each algorithm.
Assess the performance of these interpretability methods in uncovering important features and relationships within the data.
Compare the results obtained through these methods to what is known to be important in well-known databases with predetermined outcomes.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:
Gain insights into the inner workings of machine learning algorithms, making model decisions more transparent.
Identify influential features and their impact on model predictions.
Improve trust and confidence in model predictions by explaining their reasoning.
Validate the effectiveness of these interpretability methods across a variety of datasets.
Verify if interpretability methods can accurately identify known significant factors in predetermined databases.
Disadvantages:
Interpretability methods can be computationally expensive, especially for complex models.
The level of interpretability may vary depending on the algorithm, making it challenging to have a consistent standard.
Interpretability is not always a guarantee of model performance; it may not improve predictive accuracy.
The choice of hyperparameters or settings for PDP and feature importance may affect the results.
Interpretability methods might not always perfectly replicate the known important factors in predetermined databases.
Datasets
Various datasets, both publicly available and possibly some created for the project, will be used to test the interpretability methods. These datasets will be carefully selected to cover a wide range of domains and complexities to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

Usage
The code and notebooks used in this project will be available in this repository, along with detailed instructions for running the experiments and generating interpretability visualizations.

Results
The results of this study will be documented and presented in the form of reports and visualizations to showcase the effectiveness and limitations of PDP and feature importance methods in understanding the decision-making process of the selected machine learning algorithms.
